## Introduction

Hath~Wasi (හත් වාසි ) is a Sri lankan traditional card game that shows many similarities to well known OMI (ඕමී) but played only with three players. And this is it's implementation on android.

To play this game, it uses only cards greater than 5 of all suits. Therefore the selected 36 cards will be dealt among the three players equally (12 each) and dealing of cards will happen anti-clockwise. 

In the first round the human player will get the chance to bid for the game which means, the human player should check for 7 possible chances to win the game. If not the player should pass the bidding chance to the other player (This happens anti-clockwise too). 

In the case, when all the players pass the chance, the round will be cancelled and the shuffling and dealing of cards will happen again and again till a player bids. 

The suit which was selected will be the trump for the round and it will be indicated in the middle of the status bar. 

The player who bids will be the individual team and the other players will be the opposition team.

In this game, two of the players are CPU players.

## How to Play

The objective of Hath Wasi is to score the highest number of points from 10 games. 

The first team to win seven chances will win the game and once a team wins a game and the game will no longer be played.

The team which bids will start the game by playing the first card and the playing of card will happen anticlockwise.

The team who played the card with the highest value will get 2 points and the team with 2 players will get 1 point each.
